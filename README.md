Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
ANSWER: Software Engineering is a systematic process to develop high quality software in a predictable time frame and budget.
IMPORTANCE OF IN THE TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY: Software Engineering helps in the technology industry by enabling the creation of software applications and systems for various aspects of life such as COMMUNICATION, COMMERCE, ENTERTAINMENT and HEALTHCARE.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
•Development of programming languages
•Rise of Agile methodologies in the 2000s
•Advent of structured programming in the 1970s


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
•REQUIREMENTS: Gathering of user needs and creating of system requirements
•DESIGN: Development of Architecture and creation of Design documents.
•IMPLEMENTATION: Writing of Code
•TESTING: Identifying and fixing of Bugs and ensuring software meets quality standards. 
•DEPLOYMENT: Releasing of code to production environment.
•MAINTENANCE: Identifying issues and suggestion of code enhancements.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
•WATERFALL offers a structured approach with clear stages, suitable for projects with fixed requirements. 
Watterfall is best suited for projects with well-defined requirements and minimal expected changes. For example, developing software for a regulated medical device where precise documentation and adherence to specifications are crucial.

•AGILE: provides flexibility and iterative progress, making it better for projects with dynamic requirements and a need for ongoing user input.
Agile is Ideal for projects with evolving requirements and a need for frequent updates. For example, developing a mobile app where user feedback and market trends may drive ongoing changes and feature additions.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering 
•SOFTWARE DEVELOPER: software developers write the code that powers the software and also implement the architecture laid out in the design document 
•QUALITY ASSURANCE ENGINEER: QA engineers ensure the quality of the product and that the software meets customer requirements
•PROJECT MANAGER: oversees planning, execution and delivery of software projects


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
•IDEs: they are software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging and testing code. example: VISUAL CODE, ECLIPSE
•VCS: they are software tools for tracking changes to source code and also coordinate work among team members. example: GIT, SUBVERSION 


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
•CHANGING REQUIREMENTS: Requirements may change during development cycle leading to project delays
•TIGHT DEADLINES: pressure to deliver products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality 
•TECHNICAL DEBT: accumulation of suboptimal code or design that impacts future development 

STRATEGIES TO OVERCOME THESE CHALLENGES: Effective communication, Agile methodologies and prioritization of tasks


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
•UNIT TESTING: it tests individual components or modules of software 
IMPORTANCE: Identifies issues at the earliest stage of development, allowing for easier and quicker fixes.

•INTEGRATION TESTING: tests interaction between different components or subsystems.
IMPORTANCE: Detects issues that occur when different components interact, which may not be evident in unit tests.

•SYSTEM TESTING: tests the entire software system
IMPORTANCE: It helps identify issues that arise when the entire system is in operation.

•ACCEPTANCE TESTING: tests the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs
IMPORTANCE: It helps ensure the final product is usable and acceptable to the customer.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
PROMPT ENGINEERING: it is crafting questions in a way that helps get the best responses for an AI assistant or robot.
IMPORTANCE: prompt engineering is crucial for interacting with AI models because it ensures that the AI’s responses align with user expectations and requirements, ultimately enhancing the effectiveness and efficiency of AI-driven tasks.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
ANSWER: 
VAGUE PROMPT:Tell me about security.
IMPROVED PROMPT: Explain the best practices for securing web applications against SQL injection attacks.
By refining the prompt, the request becomes more actionable, leading to a more relevant and targeted response.
